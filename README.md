**Notes & Challenges**

During the assignment, the following challeneges were encoutered:

Difficuly setting up a connection with the oracle database configuration assistant

**solution:** Ensured proper connection as SYSDVA and verified the paths used.

Opening OEM on my laptop as the computer kept picking it as a harmful site.




**conclusion**

This assignment allowed me to have handson experience on what should be done and what it takes to build a running pluggable database this ensures i understand how to create, delete and manage a database.
